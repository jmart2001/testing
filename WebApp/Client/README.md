# WhatToCook

WhatToCook is a recipe-based application. This web application has many features
to make cooking easier. Overall the user will be able to find recipes based on
their current ingredients or preferred taste, perform cost analysis on their
grocery lists, and plan meals for themselves and groups. This application will
allow people to prepare their meals efficiently while also having the option
to be cautious of the price of those meals.

## Setup

Here you list all the one-time things the developer needs to do after cloning
your repo. Sometimes there is no need for this section, but some apps require
some first-time configuration from the developer, for example: setting up a
database for running your webapp locally.

## Running

Specify the commands for a developer to run the app from the cloned repo.

# Deployment

Webapps need a deployment section that explains how to get it deployed on the
Internet. These should be detailed enough so anyone can re-deploy if needed
. Note that you **do not put passwords in git**.

Mobile apps will also sometimes need some instructions on how to build a
"release" version, maybe how to sign it, and how to run that binary in an
emulator or in a physical phone.
